    a1:"The room is cold and dark. Maybe there's a light switch somewhere, but you'll never find it. There's a faint glow to the south.",
    a2:"It's so dark here you question your own existence.",
    a3:"",
    a4:"",
    b1:"A short hallway extends to the east. There are bloody footprints leading that way.",
    b2:"The footprints have become puddles here. A door leading to the south has been ripped off it's hinges. Hairs on the back of your neck begin to stand on end as you think of what could have done that to the door.",
    b3:"",
    b4:"",
    c1:"You stumble on something soft and fall to your knees. As you stand you hear a voice. It says, \"Congratulations are the One Millionth Customer! Please sneeze into your left pocket to claim your prize.\"",
    c2:"A windowless, but dimmly lit room extends to the east. The blood seems to trail off in that direction. Across the room, a tattered reclining chair sits in the middle of a dim pool of light cast by a wooden standing lamp. A pipe smolders in an ashtray on the floor nearby.",
    c3:"Behind the recliner you find a pile of knitting magazines topped by a plate of cheetos. To the north there is a large metal door, which is locked. To the east, the kitchen.",
    c4:"The kitchen hasn't been cleaned this century. Dishes are piled on every surface, and the cabinets are all filled to the top with knitting magazines from the past 30 years. Peering through stacks of magazines that nearly reach the ceiling, it appears that the kitchen extends further south.",
    d1:"Groping in the dark you finally touch a wall. It's cold and damp, like a cellar wall. It leads away north. The stench is now nearly unbearable.",
    d2:"The passage is long and dark. The smell of rotting food is overwhelming despite the breeze. The darkness continues westward.",
    d3:"The pantry is nearly empty. As you rummage through another stack of magazines, a sheet of plywood behind the shelves falls backward a few inches. It looks like there's a room behind the shelves. A light push moves the wood aside, revealing a dark passageway leading west with a slight steady breeze pushing against your face.",
    d4:"Behind the mountain of magazines there is a window looking out into the alley where a dumpster is overflowing. To the west is a rotting pantry door."
